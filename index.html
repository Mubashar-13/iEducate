        <p class="sectionTag">The End of Artificial World is Here</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag">Artificial intelligence (AI) presents exciting opportunities to improve peopleâ€™s lives, including by making our public services better. AI will support with the delivery of the Plan for Change and our opportunity mission.
            If used safely, effectively and with the right infrastructure in place, AI can support every child and young person, regardless of their background, to achieve at school and college and develop the knowledge and skills they need for life.  
            Using AI in education settings: support materials provides free online support to help with the safe and effective use of AI in education.  
            AI has the power to transform education by helping teachers focus on what they do best: teaching. This marks a shift in how we use technology to enhance lives and tap into the vast potential of AI in our classrooms.
            To make the opportunity a reality, we will continue to explore this technology safely to encourage innovation and maximise the benefits for education.
            Generative AI has demonstrated that it can help the education workforce by reducing some of the administrative burdens that hard-working teachers, staff and school leaders face in their day-to-day roles.
            Research demonstrates that generative AI could also be used for tasks such as feedback and tailored support in schools.
            Evidence is still emerging on the benefits and risks of pupils and students using generative AI themselves. We will continue to work with the education sector to develop understanding of effective and safe use cases.
            We will:
            consider the risks and challenges alongside the opportunities and benefits
            continue to work to ensure the safety and reliability of technology, including AI tools, to support teachers and learners
            address the fundamental barriers to effective use, such as connectivity</p>
