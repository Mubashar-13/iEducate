        <p class="sectionSubTag">Artificial intelligence (AI) presents exciting opportunities to improve peopleâ€™s lives, including by making our public services better. AI will support with the delivery of the Plan for Change and our opportunity mission.
            If used safely, effectively and with the right infrastructure in place, AI can support every child and young person, regardless of their background, to achieve at school and college and develop the knowledge and skills they need for life.  
            Using AI in education settings: support materials provides free online support to help with the safe and effective use of AI in education.  
            AI has the power to transform education by helping teachers focus on what they do best: teaching. This marks a shift in how we use technology to enhance lives and tap into the vast potential of AI in our classrooms.
            To make the opportunity a reality, we will continue to explore this technology safely to encourage innovation and maximise the benefits for education.
            AI has demonstrated that it can help the education workforce by reducing some of the administrative burdens that hard-working teachers, staff and school leaders face in their day-to-day roles.
            Research demonstrates that generative AI could also be used for tasks such as feedback and tailored support in schools.
            Evidence is still emerging on the benefits and risks of pupils and students using generative AI themselves. We will continue to work with the education sector to develop understanding of effective and safe use cases.
            We will:
            consider the risks and challenges alongside the opportunities and benefits
            continue to work to ensure the safety and reliability of technology, including AI tools, to support teachers and learners

            address the fundamental barriers to effective use, such as connectivity.</p>

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">Transforming Authentic Knowledge</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag">Authentic instruction will take on a much different form than traditional teaching methods. In the traditional classroom, students take a passive role in the learning process. Knowledge is considered to be a collection of facts and procedures that are transmitted from the teacher to the student. In this view, the goal of education is to possess a large collection of these facts and procedures.[3] Authentic learning, on the other hand, takes a constructivist approach, in which learning is an active process. Teachers provide opportunities for students to construct their own knowledge through engaging in self-directed inquiry, problem solving, critical thinking, and reflections in real-world contexts. This knowledge construction is heavily influenced by the student's prior knowledge and experiences, as well as by the characteristics that shape the learning environment, such as values, expectations, rewards, and sanctions. Education is more student-centered. Students no longer simply memorize facts in abstract and artificial situations, but they experience and apply information in ways that are grounded in reality.</p>

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">Revolution Begins Here</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag">Knowledge can be produced in many ways. The main source of empirical knowledge is perception, which involves the usage of the senses to learn about the external world. Introspection allows people to learn about their internal mental states and processes. Other sources of knowledge include memory, rational intuition, inference, and testimony.[a] According to foundationalism, some of these sources are basic in that they can justify beliefs, without depending on other mental states. Coherentists reject this claim and contend that a sufficient degree of coherence among all the mental states of the believer is necessary for knowledge. According to infinitism, an infinite chain of beliefs is needed.</p>
